### Introduction

The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measurement of relative size based on the mass and height of an individual.

The BMI for a person is defined as their body mass divided by the square of their height with the value universally being given in units of kg/m^2 

#### $$BMI = \frac{mass_{kg}}{height_m^2}$$


### Know Your Risks

A frequent use of the BMI is to assess how much an individual's body weight departs from what is normal or desirable for a person of his or her height.

A BMI value of 23 and above indicates that your weight is outside of the healthy weight range for your height.
